This repo contains the code for a presentation to be given at HackED 2023.

This is a basic GenAI chat webapp with a react frontend + flask backend. It keeps track of one conversation per user.

To run the backend:
Install required python modules with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Run with `python main.py`

To run the frontend:
In a seperate console, install the requirements with `npm i`
Then, run the dev server with `npm run dev`
Finally, navigate to localhost:5173 in your browser (or whatever port vite opened up on)
